// Good products are often born at hackathons, but few continue to be developed thereafter.
// Therefore, we propose a system for ETHglobal participants where each individual sets their own milestones after submission, continues development, and receives further grants and donations from sponsors and hackathon viewers upon achieving them.
// This creates clear goals and incentives, and is expected to promote continuous development.
// To build this system, we utilize Optimism Attestation/Safe Wallet/UMA oSnap/Push Protocol/Snapshot/Graph,
// and their respective application areas will be described later on.
